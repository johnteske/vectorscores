<p>A series of new compositions built on the web.
not new anymore but not dead/inactive either
not &quot;built on the web&quot; really--built with web technology but can be/most likely run offline
and not just one series anymore</p>
</blockquote>
<p>dynamic compositions
parts and scores
sometimes collaborative (websokcets)</p>
<p>how to run
is a rolling project, no semver
performances are now captured with tags/releases as a snapshot of the code
branches are helpful to create changes but are ultimately stale</p>
