<p>
This work is for two groups: three or more musicians performing the pitched "globject" part and two musicians playing the percussion parts.
</p>

<h3>Pitched</h3>
<p>
Play lines using the given pitches, bending the notes as the lines inside the globjects indicate.
Globjects show relative pitch range and transformation of pitch and dynamics over time.
The lines inside globjects are not meant to be interpreted literally but to illustrate the relative duration and pitch content of lines.
</p>

<h3>Percussion</h3>
<p>
In tempo, use the two rhythms cells provided in each part, in any order, to create a continuous line.
The musician playing the first percussion part should cue both percussion parts in and out when rhythms are displayed or hidden.
