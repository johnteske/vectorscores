    "name": "bow hair pull",
    "description": "Before playing, tie a single bow hair to a string. The G and C strings work well on violin and viola, the A and G strings work well for cello and bass. With rosin on fingers, gently pinch the hair and run your fingers along it moving your hand away from the instrument. You may also pinch the hair between a finger and rosin. It is helpful to keep a rag nearby to wipe rosin off fingers. Example: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlWLuchrMuQ"
